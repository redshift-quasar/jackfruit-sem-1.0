# Hangman Python Project

A simple word guessing game where the player tries to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts.

## Description

This project will be a command-line Hangman game implemented in Python. The computer will pick a random word, and the player will try to guess it one letter at a time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your computer.

### Running the Game

Once the code is ready, you will be able to run the game by executing the Python script:

      python hangman.py


## How to Play

- The game chooses a random word.
- You guess one letter per turn.
- Correct guesses reveal the letters in the word.
- Wrong guesses reduce the number of tries.
- The game ends when you guess the word or run out of tries.
